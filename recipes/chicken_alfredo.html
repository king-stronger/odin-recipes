        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Cook the Pasta</h3>
                <p>
                    Cook fettuccine according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain the rest
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Cook the chicken</h3>
                <p>
                    In a skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add sliced chicken breasts, season with salt and pepper, and cook until golden and cooked through. Remove from the skillet and set aside
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Prepare the Alfredo Sauce</h3>
                <p>
                    In the same skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Pour in heavy cream and bring to a simmer. Stir in grated Parmesan cheese and cook until the sauce thickens, stirring frequently
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Combine Pasta and Sauce</h3>
                <p>
                    Add the cooked fettuccine to the skillet with the Alfredo sauce. Toss to coat the pasta evenly. If the sauce is too thick, add reserved pasta water a little at a time until desired consistency is reached. Add the cooked chicken back to the skillet and mix well
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Serve</h3>

                    Divide the pasta among plates and top with freshly ground black pepper and chopped parsley, if desired
