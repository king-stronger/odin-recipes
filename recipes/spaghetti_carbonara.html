            Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish that combines the creamy richness of eggs and cheese with the savory flavor of pancetta or bacon. This dish is known for its simplicity and quick preparation, making it a favorite for both weeknight dinners and special occasions. The sauce is made by whisking eggs and Parmesan cheese together, which then coats the hot pasta, creating a silky, luxurious texture
