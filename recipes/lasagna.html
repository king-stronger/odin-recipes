                Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its comforting and hearty layers. It features flat pasta sheets, rich meat sauce, and a blend of cheeses. The dish is typically prepared by alternating layers of lasagna noodles with a flavorful Bolognese sauce made from ground beef, tomatoes, onions, and garlic. This is then combined with a creamy mixture of ricotta and mozzarella cheese, creating a perfect harmony of textures and flavors

                Baked to a golden, bubbly perfection, lasagna is a beloved family favorite and a staple at gatherings. The top layer is often finished with extra cheese, which melts and forms a delicious, crispy crust. Whether enjoyed fresh out of the oven or as leftovers, lasagna remains a go-to comfort food that brings warmth and satisfaction to any meal.
